Every journey has an end. This one took over 5 years, countless hours in front of the screens and (if I estimated correctly) one thousand litters of coffee. This would not be possible if not for the help and support of supervisors, colleagues, friends, and family. I thank you all for your support for all these years! Thank you!

The thesis is open access and can be downloaded from the repository of Delft University of Technology: <br>
[Molecular Modeling of Supramolecular Structures](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:2c876b61-a850-4ae1-b47d-38a60a576006)
<br>
and consist of four chapters:
1. Lessons learned from molecular dynamics of trifold hydrogen bonded fibers with different force-fields (I hope we will publish it) 
2. Fiber formation seen through the high resolution computational microscope (submitted)
3. Nucleation mechanisms of self-assembled physisorbed monolayers on graphite (published, J. Phys. Chem. C, 2019, 123, 28, 17510-17520)
4. Mechanism of Ostwald Ripening in 2D physisorbed assemblies at molecular time- and length-scales by Molecular Dynamics simulations (published, J. Phys. Chem. C,2018, 122, 42, 24380-24385)


I had privilege that a couple of amazing people deeply read and review my thesis, which I am grateful and which resulted in exciting discussions during the defense.

Thank you for all who support me during all these years and help me in finishing this amazing adventure!
