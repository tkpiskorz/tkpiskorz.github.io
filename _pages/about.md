I am at the last stage of my Ph.D., which I have done in the Advance Soft Matter group at TU Delft under the supervision of prof. Jan van Esch (Advance Soft Matter (ASM) group) and dr. Alex Vries (molecular dynamics (MD) group at the University of Groningen). My Ph.D. thesis is entitled "Molecular modeling of supramolecular structures."

Research Intrest
------
My main research interest is in the application of computational techniques in chemistry.  I am the most interested in combining different approaches, such as quantum mechanics, empirical simulations (i.g., MD), and data science (cheminformatics), to create reliable models for chemical systems, which could guide work in the lab towards better products.

During my Ph.D., I have been using different flavors of molecular dynamics (all-atomistic, coarse-grained, and rare-event sampling methods), and I have been using these techniques to study supramolecular and polymer systems. Besides working in ASM and MD group, I had the opportunity to go to Glasgow and work in Tuttle Lab on peptide-based supramolecular systems and go to Lyon to polymer department of Solvey to work on multiscale simulations of polymers.  Before starting my Ph.D., I have finished my M.Sc. at Warsaw University, during which I have developed Monte Carlo simulations and a model of fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS).

In my spare time, I do outdoor activities (especially hiking, running and beach volleyball), play games (board or video games), or play music (bass guitar).
